**Write down this IP address!** (Yours might be different)

### Step 3: Get the IP Address on Your Phone

1. Open Chrome on your Android phone
2. Go to: `http://192.168.1.100:3000`
   *(Replace 192.168.1.100 with YOUR IP address)*

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå Phone can't connect?

**Make sure:**
- ‚úÖ Both devices are on the SAME WiFi network
- ‚úÖ Computer firewall isn't blocking (allow ports 3000 & 5000)
- ‚úÖ VPN is turned OFF
- ‚úÖ Phone WiFi isn't set to "metered"

**Quick Test:**
Open Chrome on your computer and go to: `http://localhost:3000`
If it works on computer but not phone ‚Üí WiFi/Firewall issue

### ‚ùå Data not loading (products/videos don't show)?

**Fix the API connection:**

1. Create a file named `.env` in the `frontend` folder
2. Add this line (replace with YOUR IP):
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://192.168.1.100:5000/api
```

3. Restart the frontend server:
```bash
Ctrl+C  (stop the server)
npm run start-mobile  (start again)
```

### ‚ùå "Port 3000 already in use"?

**Kill the process:**
```powershell
# Find the process
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Kill it (replace PID with actual number)
taskkill /PID 1234 /F
```

Or just restart your computer!

### ‚ùå Still having issues?

**Try these:**
1. Disable Windows Defender temporarily
2. Check if another app is using port 3000
3. Try a different browser on your phone
4. Restart both servers

## Running in Background

**Want to keep it running?**

Both terminal windows need to stay open. You can minimize them but don't close them.

To run in background (Windows):
```powershell
# Start backend
Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "-NoExit", "-Command", "cd backend; npm run dev"

# Start frontend  
Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "-NoExit", "-Command", "cd frontend; npm run start-mobile"
```

## Alternative: Use a Cloud Service

Don't want to keep your computer on?

Deploy to a free hosting service:
- **Vercel** - vercel.com (easiest)
- **Netlify** - netlify.com
- **Heroku** - heroku.com

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions.
